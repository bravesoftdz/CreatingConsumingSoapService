# CreatingConsumingSoapService
This project is implemented from url :
http://chapmanworld.com/2015/03/30/creating-and-consuming-soap-services-in-delphi/

Thanks To CRAIG CHAPMAN

NB : The project includes IdHTTPWebBrokerBridge.pas modified to allow compile with a Indy10 version that does not include this file.
      I have also added a code snippet from IdResourceStringsProtocols.pas
